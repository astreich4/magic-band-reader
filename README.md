# Magic Band Reader
An overview mixed with a how to of how I built my Magic Band reader. 
## Introduction
I have seen a few people make these for themselves, but they lacked a good source of documentation for how and what they did.
My goal is to document what I do, the parts I use, and the code I write so that anyone can pick up this repo and do it themselves.
